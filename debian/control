Description: Apache Kafka is a distributed publish-subscribe messaging system
 Apache Kafka is designed to support the following
  * Persistent messaging with O(1) disk structures
  that provide constant time performance even with many TB of stored messages.
  * High-throughput: even with very modest hardware Kafka can support hundreds
  of thousands of messages per second.
  * Explicit support for partitioning messages over Kafka servers and
  distributing consumption over a cluster of consumer machines while
  maintaining per-partition ordering semantics.
  * Support for parallel data load into Hadoop.
